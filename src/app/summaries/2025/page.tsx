        The Year of 2025
      </div>
      <span className="block mt-8 mb-8 font-stylish text-lg">
        Zodiac year. <br />
        The year I changed the most as I learned to respect my inner self.
        <br />
        Things I used to push onto others out of laziness or avoidance, I slowly
        figured out how to handle on my own.
        <br />
        <br />
        Second year of working. <br />
        The protective shell of naivety cracked, and I realized I was already
        standing in the middle of politics.
        <br />
        The people I work with showed me that friendship doesn’t have cultural
        boundaries. It became something I want to rely on, even while fearing
        how hard goodbyes can be.
        <br />
        <br />
        Traveled five times. Three road trips.
        <br />
        Crossed two countries, passed through nine states, and stayed in ten
        cities.
        <br />I watched sunsets and stars, oceans and mountains. I saw ancient
        corners hidden inside cities, and wild bison moving freely through open
        valleys.
        <br />
        <br />
        Seven musicals and five concerts.
        <br />
        Followed an entire 24-25 figure skating season in the quiet minutes
        after waking up each morning.
        <br />
        Regained some of the body flexibility I had as a child, and completed a
        dance school performance.

      <span className="block mt-4 mb-8 font-stylish text-lg">
        My first long solo drive.
        <br />
        My first time breaking up with a best friend.
        <br />
        My first year without a fixed social circle.
        <br />
        My first time taking my family on a trip.
        <br />
        My first time shaking from fear.
        <br />
        My first personal domain.
        <br />
        My first experience of separation anxiety.
        <br />
        My first time performing on stage as an adult.
        <br />
        ...and many, many first times of trying something new, hearing new
        pieces of music, or getting to know someone.

      <span className="block mt-4 mb-8 font-stylish text-lg">
        Not talking differently to different people anymore, I stayed quiet when
        I didn’t feel like speaking, and tried my best to speak honestly when I
        did. When I met people as my real self, I found that this kind of
        openness created a space where true friends could feel me and hold my
        joy, anger, and sadness. I hope that feeling goes both ways, and that I
        can hold theirs too.
        <br />
        <br />I spent a lot of time with myself, listening to my thoughts, and
        trying to understand why I felt what I felt. From small things like
        deciding what to eat for breakfast, to big questions like whether I
        should stay in my current job, I’ve gotten used to being my own adult
        and following my heart. Still, I feel like I haven’t given myself enough
        time. There are so many things I want to do, and so many I haven’t done
        yet.
